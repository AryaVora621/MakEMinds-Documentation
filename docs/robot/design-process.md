# Engineering Design Process

Our team follows a systematic approach to robot development:

## Process Overview
1. **Identify**: Analyze game challenge and requirements
2. **Define**: Establish specific design criteria
3. **Ideate**: Brainstorm potential solutions
4. **Prototype**: Build and test initial designs
5. **Test**: Evaluate and iterate based on results

## Design Priorities
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance in matches
- **Efficiency**: Quick scoring and cycle times
- **Simplicity**: Minimize complexity where possible
- **Maintainability**: Easy access to components
