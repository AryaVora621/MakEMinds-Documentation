```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Problem/Challenge] --> B[Process/Journey]
    B --> C[Solution/Impact]
    C --> D[Learning/Growth]
```

### 2. Content Types Matrix

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| Technical | Document engineering decisions | CAD designs, code architecture |
| Process | Show methodology | Design iterations, testing results |
| Impact | Demonstrate outcomes | Community reach, competition results |
| Growth | Highlight development | Skills gained, lessons learned |

## Writing Guidelines ✍️

### Voice and Tone
- **Professional**: Clear, concise language
- **Active Voice**: "We designed..." vs. "It was designed..."
- **Engaging**: Use strong verbs and specific examples
- **Authentic**: Share real experiences and challenges

### Structure Tips
1. Start with clear objectives
2. Use descriptive headings

| Diagrams | Technical concepts | Clean lines, labeled parts |
| Charts | Data presentation | Clear axes, readable text |
| Process Maps | Workflows | Logical flow, numbered steps |

### Design Elements
